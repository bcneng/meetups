# meetups

A repo por managing Barcelona meetups.

## howto

We can try a README.md driven-development:

- each root directory represents a meetup and has a README.md
- inside there are files per meetup event, you could use the YYYYmmdd prefix to be lexicographically sorted by date
- the meetup README could have an index with a brief description of every file
- you can use the issues to discuss about topics for your meetup, or where to host the events, who are going etc.

## start a new meetup

Just create a PR holding the new directory and its README.
